- **Who is this for**: Any tecnologist that wants to understand advanced GitHub Copilot features as it applies to working with Python and data. Software Engineers, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and anyone working with Python or data might benefit from this workshop too.
- **What you'll learn**: You'll use advanced GitHub Copilot features and apply it to a project using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Data. You will learn how to ask questions about the project, use agents to create and extend analyses, and customize your own agents.
- **What you'll build**:  A new Jupyter notebook that wrangles some CSV data, exports high resolution graphics, and generates an shareable report.


## Learning Objectives
In this workshop, you will: 

- Use advanced GitHub Copilot features like slash commands, inline chat, and agents like `@workspace`
- Apply GitHub Copilot suggestions and interactions to a data science project, especially in Jupyter Notebooks
- Understand how to build agents that can speed up your data science projects

## :mega: Prerequisites

Before joining the workshop, there is only one prerequisite: you must have a public GitHub account. All resources, dependencies, and data are part of the repository itself.


## :books: Resources
