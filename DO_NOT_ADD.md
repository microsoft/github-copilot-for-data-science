The 45 min tutorial will showcase GitHub Copilot workflows and patterns tailored for data science, with a focus on practical applications and collaborative development. Attendees will gain insights into how using Copilot in VS Code can accelerate experimentation and streamline data science tasks in real-world scenarios. There will be plenty of time for questions at the end!

Some things/ideas that come to mind (but feel free to add/use your own):
Exploratory analysis on rough data
Organizing meaningful visualizations from data
Transforming data for ML and creating useful regression models

45 minute delivery + 10-15 minute Q&A (online)
Background is 100% Data Scientists that are starting or want to start using GitHub Copilot
Delivery is live remote (online) - not recorded
The products are: Jupyter, VSCode, and GitHub Copilot

Introduction to GitHub Copilot for Data Science
Use real-world examples, like:
analyzing bad data and identifying incorrect data patterns
exploratory data analysis 
visualization

"crazy4pi314: Help me start a new jupyter notebook that loads the villager data and starts analyzing the data. Use scikitlearn to start analyzing the correlation between species and personality

GitHub Copilot: I'll (1) write a todo plan and mark the first task in-progress, then (2) create a new Jupyter notebook that loads villagers.csv and starts the scikit-learn analysis (mutual info + small classifier) so you can run it immediately. Expected outcome: notebook file created and todo list updated. I'll run these two actions in parallel. "
